<p>In this notebook my team mates and I try to predict flight arrival delay based on a provided dataset of 9k entries.</p>

<p>We were able to find a good estimation of the flight arrival delay, getting
advantage of boosting methods to get a better score out of a simple decision tree model to get better predictions.</p>

<p><i>please ask for the full report theat shows our methodology and results if interested</i></p>
